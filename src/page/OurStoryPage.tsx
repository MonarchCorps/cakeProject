                                Studying to become a Chemical Engineer meant that processes were part and parcel of how I viewed things.
                                On the flip side, being a major sweet tooth with a natural flair for working with my hands, I landed at the
                                Skills Fair hosted by the Blaze Student Society at The University of Manchester. Fast-forward to today, in Year 10 since the conception of Hegai Cakes,
                                I love exciting the tastebuds of my clients through a well of flavours,
                                not without feeding their eyes with designs that live on. Best part of it all - weâ€™re just getting started! Strap up!
